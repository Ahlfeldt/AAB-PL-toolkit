# Toolkit for Prime Locations (AABPL)
(c) Gabriel M. Ahlfeldt, Thilo N. H. Albers, Kristian Behrens
Version 1.0.0, 2024-10

## General description

This toolkit complements Ahlfeldt, Albers, Behrens (2024), which develops a delineation algorithm for ultra-dense employment clusters within cities which is applied to US MSAs and a sample of Global Cities. This toolkit contains shapefiles of delineated prime locations for all US MSAs and the sampled Global cities, data sets that provide key statistics on these prime locations and summarize the geography of prime locations by city, as well as a Python version of the delineation algorithm which is flexibly applicable to spatial point pattern data.

When using the toolkit in your work, please cite Ahlfeldt, Albers, Behrens (2024).
